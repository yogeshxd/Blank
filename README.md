# ðŸ”¥ Screen Toggle Script  

A simple script to **turn your screen ON/OFF** while keeping everything (VNC, SSH, etc.) running.  
No manual screen names, no argumentsâ€”just run it, and it flips the state automatically! ðŸš€  

## **Usage**  
```bash
chmod +x blank.sh
./blank.sh   # Toggles the screen ON/OFF
```
Over SSH:  
```bash
ssh user@server 'bash /path/to/blank.sh'
```

**That's it!** Simple, clean, and effective. ðŸ˜Ž
